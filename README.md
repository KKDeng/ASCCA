 # Code of paper "[Trace Lasso Regularization for Adaptive Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis  via Manifold Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09195.pdf)"

Our code is based on "[manopt toolbox](https://www.manopt.org/index.html)" and code in paper "[An inexact augmented Lagrangian method for nonsmooth optimization on Riemannian manifold](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09900)" 



ASCCA is a adaptive sparse CCA model by incorporating the matrix trace Lasso regularization
